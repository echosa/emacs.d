;;; Commentary:

;; Intelligent in-buffer completion which is not specialized on
;; commands with arguments.

;; See `incomplete-function' on how to use it.
;; Just bind TAB to 'incomplete.

Of the returned list, the first element must be the prefix at point.")

;;; Internal variabls:

(defvar incomplete-completion-timer nil
  "Timer to hide the *Completions* buffer again.")

(defvar incomplete-saved-window-configuration nil
  "The last window configuration.")

(defvar incomplete-new-window-configuration nil
