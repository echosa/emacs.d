elim is currently alpha software. 
Use at your own peril.

It is available under the GPL, as detailed in COPYING, and the 
documentation is available under the GFDL with no invariant sections,
supplied in doc/COPYING.

Having said that, you will need the following packages (including header files,
if your distro ships the -dev or -devel part as a separate package):

glib-2.0
libxml-2.0 
libpurple 

Note that the makefile will try to detect these and will complain if it 
can't find them.

On a debian stable (squeeze) system you should install at least the
following packages:

libpurple-dev

You will also need GNU Make and a C compiler.

Assuming the build dependencies are all installed, all you should need to 
do is:

  make

this should produce a binary called "elim-client".

If you want to test the daemon using the (currently incomplete) elisp 
client suport, you need to do the following:

* fire up emacs
* load elisp/garak.el
* customise or set elim-executable to the location of the elim-client binary
  (this step shouldn't be necessary now, but just in case it doesn't work)

Example .emacs configuration:

       (add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/elim/elisp")
       (load-library "garak")

M-x garak RET

To add an account:

  /add-account USERNAME PROTOCOL

eg:

  /add-account foo@jabber.org prpl-jabber
  /add-account blerg@irc.freenode.net prpl-irc

(the protocol names can be tab completed)

To configue extra account details:

  /configure-account foo@jabber.org

This will trigger an emacs widget based (defcustom style) UI being set up
for you to fill out the details in.

If the account is a new one, you can then register it:

  /register ACCOUNT

To login:

  /connect USERNAME

(USERNAME can be tab-completed once accounts have been added)

NOTE: You may need to set the status offline explicitly before 
      setting it to available - this eems to be an oddity of the 
      way libpurple behaves, but it could be a mistake on my part.
      Under investigation, either way.

To join a channel/room/etc

on IRC:

  /join USERNAME #emacs

OR, if you are already in an account-specific buffer, such as an IRC channel
buffer, just:

  /join #emacs

The details vary per protocol, but garak should be able to figure out what's 
required if you just say /join USERNAME (or /join in an account-specific buffer)

To start a one-to-one conversation:

  /msg ACCOUNT BUDDY MESSAGE-TEXT

OR (in an account specific buffer)

  /msg BUDDY MESSAGE-TEXT

To add a buddy

  /add-buddy USERNAME BUDDY-NAME

OR (in an account specific buffer)

  /add-buddy BUDDY-NAME 

To start a conversation with an individual:

  /msg USERNAME BUDDY-NAME

OR (in an account specific buffer)

  /msg BUDDY-NAME

OR as the context menu from the buddy list in *Garak*

To leave a conversation:

  /part

To disconnect an account:

  /disconnect USER

OR (in an account specific buffer)

  /disconnect 

To set your status:

  /status away
  /status available
  /status invisible
  /status do-not-disturb OR /status unavailable

To set your icon/avatar/what-have-you:

  /set-icon USERNAME /path/to/icon/image

OR (in an account specific buffer)

  /set-icon /path/to/icon/image

New garak buffers should turn up in the tracking block in the mode line:

  [#emacs,#elim,etc]

You can click on the buffer names in the mode line or switch to them in the 
usual way.

That's all that's implemented for now, it's all only just been written so 
hasn't had a lot of testing.

To display the buddy list:

M-x garak-gui RET

Not that the buddy list widget/buffer is only partially implemented, 
you cannot block or unblock buddies (yet), even though the menu item 
is present.

To recreate the *Garak* buffer, M-x garak-gui RET in the *garak*
buffer or any conversation buffer.

To set garak's own options and preferences:

M-x customize-group RET garak RET 

To set libpurple's preferences, issue the /prefs command.
