All function calls implemented by the daemon are implemented here.
Each file implements one externally exposed function. Each file and 
function should be named according to the following pattern, and have 
the indicated signature: 

daemon function: foo-bar
files          : foo_bar.c; foo_bar.h
c return type  : xmlnode * 
c function name: _h_elim_foo_bar
c signature    : const char *name, const char *id, SEXP_VALUE *a, gpointer data

minimal contents of header:

#ifndef _EMACSIM_HANDLER_FOO_BAR_H_
#define _EMACSIM_HANDLER_FOO_BAR_H_

#include <glib.h>
#include "../elim-rpc.h"

xmlnode * _h_elim_foo_bar ( const char *name , 
                            const char *id   ,
                            SEXP_VALUE *args , 
                            gpointer    data );

#endif
