The way this is intended to work is to have this directory checked out in the Dropbox folder, and of course have Dropbox on the system.

The following symlink should be created in ~:

.emacs -> ~/Dropbox/emacs/custom/<APPROPRIATE FILE>.el

The following items should be symlinked into ~/.emacs.d:

bookmarks -> ~/Dropbox/emacs/bookmarks/<APPROPRIATE FILE>
elpa -> ~/Dropbox/emacs/elpa
my-term-theme-theme.el -> ~/Dropbox/emacs/my-term-theme-theme.el
