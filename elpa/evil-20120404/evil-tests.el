;; evil-tests.el --- unit tests for Evil -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

;; This file is for developers. It runs some tests on Evil.
;; To load it, run the Makefile target "make test" or add
;; the following lines to .emacs:
;;
;;     (setq evil-tests-run nil) ; set to t to run tests immediately
;;     (global-set-key [f12] 'evil-tests-run) ; hotkey
;;     (require 'evil-tests)
;;
;; Loading this file enables profiling on Evil. The current numbers
;; can be displayed with `elp-results'. The Makefile target
;; "make profiler" shows profiling results in the terminal on the
;; basis of running all tests.
;;
;; To write a test, use `ert-deftest' and specify a :tags value of at
;; least '(evil). The test may inspect the output of functions given
;; certain input, or it may execute a key sequence in a temporary
;; buffer and investigate the results. For the latter approach, the
;; macro `evil-test-buffer' creates a temporary buffer in Normal
;; state. String descriptors initialize and match the contents of
;; the buffer:
;;
;;     (ert-deftest evil-test ()
;;       :tags '(evil)
;;       (evil-test-buffer
;;        "[T]his creates a test buffer." ; cursor on "T"
;;        ("w")                           ; key sequence
;;        "This [c]reates a test buffer."))) ; cursor moved to "c"
;;
;; The initial state, the cursor syntax, etc., can be changed
;; with keyword arguments. See the documentation string of
;; `evil-test-buffer' for more details.
;;
;; This file is NOT part of Evil itself.

If a form is a list of strings or vectors, it is taken to be a
